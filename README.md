# Aurelia Webpack Skeleton

## Getting Started
Make sure you have a recent version of NodeJS *>=6.0* with NPM 3 or Yarn.

From the project folder, execute the following command:

```shell
npm install # or yarn install
```

This will install the dependencies, including a local version of Webpack and TypeScript. So no need to have them installed globally.

The command will start the webpack development server that watches for file changes. The site should then be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
